# Predicting-compressive-strength-of-samples
Predicting compressive strength based on the ingredients of the sample is the goal of this project.  We used Keras regression Neural Network to build our model. The dataset is about the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different ingredients that were used to make them. 

All the procedure is explained in the code with graphs
